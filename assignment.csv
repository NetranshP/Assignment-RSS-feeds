Seven years? Not since James Joyce took a similar timeframe to write Ulysses has there been such a slow-cooked Irish literary stew. And as Peter O’Reilly, Sexton’s excellent (and potentially long-suffering) ghostwriter, reveals in the final acknowledgments, there was little need for many supplementary interviews because of “Johnny’s exceptional memory for detail”. Combine those twin ingredients and a tasty dish is all but assured.</p><p>Because Johnny can remember everything and everyone. What his friends said and did, what his enemies were thinking (or, at least, what he <em>thought</em><strong> </strong>they were thinking), how he felt at certain crucial moments. If it reads at times like a cold-eyed dispatch from an endless battle that is, for a good deal of his career, how it felt. “For so much of the time I was at war – with opponents, with rivals, sometimes with coaches, often with myself. For the most part … it felt like a fight.”</p> <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/oct/08/jonny-sexton-book-rugby-union-the-breakdown"">Continue reading...</a>",08-10-2024,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/oct/08/jonny-sexton-book-rugby-union-the-breakdown,Others

Johan Neeskens was knocked out during it, floored by a punch from Brazil’s captain Marinho Peres. That felt typical.

Sublimely skilled as that Dutch side were, they were also more than capable of looking after themselves and when it came to mixing it there was no one better than Neeskens.</p><p>But Neeskens also scored the Dutch opener in that game, receiving the ball halfway inside the Brazil half, pushing the ball to Cruyff on the right then continuing his run to sweep in a first-time finish. Perhaps there was an element of fortune in the loop of the ball over the goalkeeper Émerson Leão, but the key to the goal was his dart in front of Luís Pereira to meet Cruyff’s pass, the awareness of where Cruyff was going to deliver the ball, the instinct to time his movement, and then the technique to guide the ball on target. In a brilliant and brutal game, it was Neeskens, their most brutally brilliant player, who shone.</p> <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/oct/08/johan-neeskens-deserves-place-next-to-cruyff-in-total-football-pantheon"">Continue reading...</a>",08-10-2024,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/oct/08/johan-neeskens-deserves-place-next-to-cruyff-in-total-football-pantheon,Others

She made a series of collages by cutting it up, including one in which rolls of brown packing paper are arranged in a star-like symmetrical pattern. And that’s it. The Hayward’s retrospective of this 53-year-old South Korean is full of stuff like this. It is immense, crowded and completely unrewarding. None of it adds up and none of it is moving – unless you are the kind of person who tears up over a venetian blind. “Venetian blinds are a prominent feature,” says a wall text, explaining Yang’s work. “She is particularly drawn to their tilted slats.”</p><p>In one installation, these tilted slats cover the sides of illuminated boxes. It comes as a shock when you read that this neutral-looking work is entitled 5, Rue Saint-Benoit and is meant to suggest the Paris home of the novelist Marguerite Duras where she lived as a member of the resistance in the second world war. Looking again, you see that one of the blinded crates is painted like a tricolour.

What’s stopping us?</p><p>In traditional societies, little to no food goes to waste. Every edible part of an animal or plant is utilised. Researchers found that the members of a Maasai cattle herding community in northern Tanzania were outraged at the thought of intentionally wasting food, calling those who would do so “lunatics”. Some even said it was worse than killing a person, because murder leads to one death, whereas wasting food could result in several.</p><p>Attitudes towards waste are very different in industrialised nations. The United Nations Environment Programme (Unep) estimates that 17% of total global food production is wasted and around the same amount lost, meaning that around a third of food produced is not consumed. The global average for household waste is 74kg per person annually, and this figure is broadly similar for lower-, middle- and high-income countries.</p> <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/oct/08/the-scandal-of-food-waste-and-how-we-can-stop-it"">Continue reading...</a>",08-10-2024,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/oct/08/the-scandal-of-food-waste-and-how-we-can-stop-it,Others
